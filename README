
This is the Triage operating system. The project resources are:

   * Mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/triage-os
   * Blog: http://8b435bfe.blogspot.com/
   * Precompiled docs:  https://github.com/8b435bfe/Triage-docs
   * Public repository: https://github.com/8b435bfe/Triage

Any version of Triage downloaded from an URL different than the one
above should not be trusted by default. Be sure to review the source
and look for differences with the official source code.

Please send all bug reports, patches, and so forth to the mailing list.
When sending files, use free file formats such as ODT, SVG and PNG.
All proprietary file formats (RAR, DOC, XLS, PPT ...) will be ignored.
Always send source code; do not send precompiled binaries. Finally,
avoid the PDF file format and prefer the rST or ODT 1.2 file formats.

By sending a contribution to the mailing list, you therefore agree that

The copyright is shared amongst contributors, who are to be identified
in all git commits. For example, if contributor A provides a new file
"foo", he owns the copyright on that original file. Then if contributor B
provides a patch that changes "foo", he owns the copyright on those
changes.

You are welcome to fork the Triage project. However, when doing so please
use a non ambiguous name for the new project. For example, "Triage 2.0"
would be confusing for the users, whereas "Triphase" would not be ambiguous.
